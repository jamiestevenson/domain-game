TODO:
Add action economy with seasonal clock

Issues - adding army - to do this properly, probably need to
add in start and end of season handlers - which makes sense, because
the whole game will have a TURN button.  In reality, only domains
need to know about turns and the season.  domains, however are
getting a bit big.
