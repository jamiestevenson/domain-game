TODO:
Add action economy with seasonal clock

Issues - adding army - to do this properly, probably need to
add in start and end of season handlers - which makes sense, because
the whole game will have a TURN button.  In reality, only domains
need to know about turns and the season.  domains, however are
getting a bit big.

JavaFX - this may be a better option going forward - it would be nice
if I just wrap model components in menus - rather than building a
separate system of UX to re-attach.

REDESIGN: Need to think about more layered architecture for separating
army movement stuff out of domain as it is getting too fat.

Also need to consider where army sustainability rules are stored, 
probably in the armies themselves - in which case there will need to be
a way of cleaning up the equipment and removing itself from the game.
